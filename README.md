# Semantic-HW

A simple, accessible, and semantic HTML/CSS project showcasing best practices for document structure, media embedding, and clean styling. This repository can serve as a reference or starter for students practicing semantic markup and basic web layout.

## Highlights

- Semantic HTML structure for improved accessibility and SEO
- Clean, maintainable CSS for basic layout and typography
- Example usage of local media assets (image and video)
- Minimal dependencies — open directly in a browser

## Project Structure

```
Semantic-HW/
├── index.html        # Main HTML page using semantic elements
├── styles.css        # Styles for layout, spacing, and typography
├── Images/
│   └── image1.jpg    # Sample image used in the page
├── Videos/
│   └── video1.mp4    # Sample video embedded in the page
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

No build steps are required. Open index.html in any modern browser.

- On Windows: double‑click index.html
- Or via terminal: navigate to this folder and run
  - PowerShell: `Start-Process .\index.html`
  - CMD: `start index.html`

## Usage

- Replace Images/image1.jpg and Videos/video1.mp4 with your own media if desired, keeping the same filenames or updating paths in index.html accordingly.
- Customize styles in styles.css to adjust colors, spacing, and typography.
- Extend semantic structure in index.html (e.g., add sections, articles, nav, header/footer) as needed.

## Accessibility and Semantic Notes

- Use appropriate landmarks and headings in index.html to improve screen reader navigation.
- Provide descriptive alt text for images (e.g., `alt="A description of image1"`).
- For videos, include controls and consider providing captions or transcripts.

## Recommended Edits (if you continue developing)

- Add a favicon and metadata to improve presentation and sharing (title, description, Open Graph tags).
- Create a components section in the HTML to demonstrate lists, tables, forms, and buttons with accessible labeling.
- Add a basic responsive layout using CSS media queries.
